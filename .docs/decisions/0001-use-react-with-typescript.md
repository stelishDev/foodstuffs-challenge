# Use React with TypeScript

## Context and Problem Statement

We want to choose a front-end framework that is popular (can hire developers in a difficult market) and provides flexibility to accommodate the needs of the project.

## Considered Options

- [VueJS](https://vuejs.org) - Is performant and flexible, but is not as popular as React.
- [Angular](https://angular.io) â€“ Is in the top 3 for front-end frameworks, but is the most complex and least flexible. It is required to use TypeScript with Angular which is great for maintenance.
- [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org) - Is the most popular front-end framework in 2021, and is therefor the easiest to hire developers for.

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "ReactJS", because

- It's the most popular front-end framework and the project needs developers ASAP due to a looming deadline.
- It's a flexible library that means uncertain future requirements could be met without much risk.
- Use with TypeScript to limit the number of runtime bugs.
